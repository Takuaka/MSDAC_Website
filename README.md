# MSDAC_Website
Personal Project - creating a website for my church (Mizpah Seventh-Day Adventist Church)

Gonna jot down my general ideas here and work through them

- Main Page
- About Us
- Contact
- Current Events
- Social Media Links
- Other Resources

Then, to learn database and logins:

Adding posts? Might just work with current posts on main pages

Turns out all the main pages are hidden; I will try it eventually anyway
