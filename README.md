# MSDAC_Website
Personal Project - creating a website for my church (Mizpah Seventh-Day Adventist Church)

Gonna jot down my general ideas here and work through them

- Main Page:
    Main page of the website, should be able to navigate to everything from here
    Example layout: https://adventist.org.nz/
    Main navigation on top, to every page (should have this on every page)
    Just put in a picture slideshow? I guess. Nothing else really to put there

- About Us

    Should put here a little spiel about the church, and the pastor
    Maybe put the names of all the officers/Board members here? idk
- Contact

    Prolly just the social pages. Should ask if we're gonna make them public
- Current Events
- Social Media Links
- Other Resources

Then, to learn database and logins:

Adding posts? Might just work with current posts on main pages

Turns out all the main pages are hidden; I will try it eventually anyway
